# Tuple
Tuple is used to store group of values under same name. 

* Tuple is used to store group of values under same name.
* Tuple allows duplicate values.
* Tuple can store group of different type of values.
* Tuple is indexed and ordered.

Basic Tuple solution:

        <class 'tuple'>
        marks= (43, 54, 65, 76, 43, 97)
        43
        54
        65
        76
        43
        97
str and float int solution:

        s= ('Kaur', 32, 'SIET', 44.44)
        Kaur
        32
        SIET
        44.44
list, set and dict.
solution:

        minimum= 22
        maximum= 87
        sum= 340
        length= 6
        sorted marks= [22, 34, 54, 65, 78, 87]
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "C:/Users/Darshan/Desktop/Built in functions which works on tuple, list, set and dict..py", line 9, in <module>
        print("marks=",marks)

Tuple supports concatenation

solution:

        d= (2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 9, 12, 4, 8, 6)
     
Tuple supports repetition

solution:

        b= (2, 4, 6, 2, 4, 6, 2, 4, 6)
     
Tuple supports slicing

solution:

        (6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16)
        (10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20)
        (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12)
        (12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30)
        30
        28
        26
        (6, 10, 14, 18, 22)
        (2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 26, 30)
        (4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28)
        (30, 28, 26, 24)
        (30, 28, 26, 24, 22, 20, 18, 16, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2)

Tuple own functions

solution:

        3
        2
        1
        0
        0
        1
Tuple is immutable

Tuple once created cannot be modified.
* cannot insert single value
* Cannot delete single value
* cannot update value

solution:

     #gives error
