# Tuple
Tuple is used to store group of values under same name. 

* Tuple is used to store group of values under same name.
* Tuple allows duplicate values.
* Tuple can store group of different type of values.
* Tuple is indexed and ordered.

Basic Tuple solution:

        <class 'tuple'>
        marks= (43, 54, 65, 76, 43, 97)
        43
        54
        65
        76
        43
        97
str and float int solution:

        s= ('Kaur', 32, 'SIET', 44.44)
        Kaur
        32
        SIET
        44.44
list, set and dict.
solution:

                minimum= 22
                maximum= 87
                sum= 340
                length= 6
                sorted marks= [22, 34, 54, 65, 78, 87]
                Traceback (most recent call last):
                File "C:/Users/Darshan/Desktop/Built in functions which works on tuple, list, set and dict..py", line 9, in <module>
                print("marks=",marks)

Tuple supports concatenation

solution:

     d= (2, 4, 6, 1, 3, 9, 12, 4, 8, 6)
     
Tuple supports repetition

solution:

     b= (2, 4, 6, 2, 4, 6, 2, 4, 6)
